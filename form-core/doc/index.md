# Form Core

```js script
import { html } from '~/core';
import '~/doc-styles';
```

The form-core package is an umbrella package for form-related utilities, two examples:

- A mixin that adds a localized default label for fields
- Generic styles for choice boxes or text-like input fields

These utilities are then applied onto multiple simba form components, which is useful as many input fields have huge overlap.

TODO: Add implementation examples for each utility
